<p>Do not seed <code>Random</code> with the current time because that value is more predictable to an attacker than the
    default seed.</p>
<p>The java.util.Random class must not be used either for security-critical applications or for protecting sensitive
    data. Use a more secure random number generator, such as the java.security.SecureRandom
    class.</p>
