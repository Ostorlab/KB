<p>
    Mobile applications must use secure API to store credentials. Android applications may <code>AccountManager</code>
    to
    store account credentials.
    It also highly recommended for mobile application to use OAuth-based authentication to avoid storing credentials and
    prevent attacks like password reuse.

<p>
    To implement OAuth-based authentication, Cordova application may use the <code>jquery-cordova-oauth2</code> library.
    Android
    application may use <code>AccountManager</code> API and iOS application may use <code>OAuth2Client</code> library.
