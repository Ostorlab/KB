<p>Firebase Realtime Database Rules determine who has read and write access to your database, how your data is structured, and what indexes exist.</p>
<p>Insecure Database permissions is a common issue, which can lead to unauthorized access to your database. Firebase provides tools to enforce Authentication, Authorization and even Data Validation.</p>
<p>The following are common misconfiguration issues to avoid:</p>
<p>Read and write access to all users:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}
</code></pre>


<p>Any logged-in user has read and write access to your entire database:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">
{
  "rules": {
      ".read": "auth !== null",
      ".write": "auth !== null"
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Realtime Database Rules cascade, with rules at more shallow, parent paths overriding rules at deeper, child nodes. When you write a rule at a child node, remember that it can only grant additional privileges. You can’t refine or revoke access to data at a deeper path in your database.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">
{
  "rules": {
     "foo": {
        // allows read to /foo/*
        ".read": "data.child('baz').val() === true",
        "bar": {
          /* ignored, since read was allowed already */
          ".read": false
        }
     }
  }
}
</code></pre>
