<p>Mobile Applications must use Secure Sockets Layer SSL / Transport Layer Security TLS to provide encryption at the
    transport layer and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data in transit.This application does not use
    SSL/TLS and is vulnerable to traffic interception and modification.</p><p>An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle
    (MITM) attack may:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Passively intercept the communication to access any sensitive data in transit like usernames, passwords or
        credit card number
    </li>
    <li>Actively inject or remove content to forge and omit information or inject malicious scripts</li>
    <li>Actively redirect the communication to the attacker in the context of the initial trusted party</li>
</ul>
