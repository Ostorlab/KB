Security can be enhanced in Server Socket operations with the SSL “Secure Sockets Layer” or the TLS “Transport Layer Security” protocols. This class extends Sockets and includes Integrity protection, authentication and confidentiality.
The code can integrate SSLSocketFactory or SSLServerSocket to add a layer of security protection over the underlying network transport protocol.
