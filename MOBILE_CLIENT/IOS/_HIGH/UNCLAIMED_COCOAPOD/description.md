# Unclaimed Cocoapods

Security researchers at E.V.A Information Security Ltd. discovered several vulnerabilities in the CocoaPods dependency manager used in macOS and iOS applications. These vulnerabilities allowed malicious actors to claim ownership of unclaimed pods and insert malicious code into popular apps. The exploitation of these vulnerabilities could have infected nearly every Apple device, posing significant financial and reputational risks to thousands of organizations. One specific vulnerability even enabled zero-day attacks against secure infrastructure. The CocoaPods team has since patched these issues, reducing the risk. However, developers are advised to verify the integrity of their dependencies and update their security practices to prevent future exploits.
