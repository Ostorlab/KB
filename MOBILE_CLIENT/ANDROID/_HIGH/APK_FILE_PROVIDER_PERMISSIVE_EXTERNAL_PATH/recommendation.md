An insecure file path provider is a vulnerability in Android apps where a file path is exposed to other apps or users, which could potentially compromise sensitive data or allow unauthorized access to system resources. 

By making your app more secure, you help preserve user trust and device integrity, so to protect your app from this vulnerability, here are some recommendations:

* Be cautious about what files you share and only share files that are necessary and appropriate.
* Don't share sensitive files or files that contain sensitive information.
* When using external-path, avoid using permissive settings like '.' as the path.
* Avoid using `root-path`.
* Don't assign the root path '/.' to the path attribute in any type of path.
* Use the <grant-uri-permission> tag to control access to shared files.
* Prefer using `external-files-path` path type.
* Use specific folders for path attributes, check the following example:


=== "XML"
	```xml
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
	<paths>
	    <external-path
	        name="downloads"
	        path="Download/" />
	</paths>
	```
