To mitigate the command injection vulnerability, here are some recommendations:
- Use input validation to ensure user-supplied data is sanitized and contains only expected values.
- Use parameterized queries to pass parameters to a query or command string in a secure manner.
- Design your app to run with the least privilege necessary to perform its intended functions.

Here's an example of a vulnerable code that is susceptible to command injection:
```java
String cmd = getIntent().getStringExtra("cmd");
Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);
```
An attacker can easily inject arbitrary commands into the cmd parameter and execute them with the privileges of the vulnerable application.

Here's an example of a secure code that uses ProcessBuilder to execute commands safely:
```java
String[] cmd = {"ls", "-al", "/path/to/directory"};
ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(cmd);
Process p = pb.start();
```

In this example, the ProcessBuilder class is used to create a secure command with the ls command, the -al flag, and the /path/to/directory parameter. By using this method, the application can securely execute the command without the risk of command injection.

By implementing these recommendations, you can help protect your app from command injection attacks, ensuring the security and integrity of your application and its users.
