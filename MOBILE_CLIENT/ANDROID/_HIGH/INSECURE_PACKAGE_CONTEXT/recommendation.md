To mitigate this vulnerability, Android developers should avoid using `createPackageContext` with `CONTEXT_INCLUDE_CODE` and `CONTEXT_IGNORE_SECURITY`. Developers should also carefully review their app's permissions and restrict them to the minimum necessary for their app's functionality. Additionally, users should be cautious when installing apps from untrusted sources and regularly update their devices to the latest security patches.
