**Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate user-supplied input to ensure it conforms to the expected format and does not contain any malicious characters or sequences. Sanitize and normalize file paths to prevent any unauthorized navigation.


**Absolute Path Usage:** Prefer using absolute paths instead of relative paths whenever possible. By using absolute paths, the application explicitly specifies the exact location of the file or directory, leaving no room for interpretation.
