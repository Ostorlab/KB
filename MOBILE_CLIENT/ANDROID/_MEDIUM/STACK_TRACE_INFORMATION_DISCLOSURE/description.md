When the server application receives unexpected input, an error is triggered returning technical information about the
application internals.

An attacker can use this information to understand how the application is handling inputs. It becomes possible to
investigate the inner workings and formulate further attack strategies. Information leakage should be suppressed to
discourage attackers and prevent access to potential critical information.
