# Overlay Vulnerability

The Overlay Vulnerability is a security flaw that allows an attacker to overlay malicious content or interfaces on top of legitimate applications, tricking users into interacting with the attacker's content instead. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing sensitive information, capturing login credentials, or performing unauthorized actions on the user's behalf.
