If you discover that one of the assets associated with your application has a bad reputation or is flagged as malicious, it's important to take action to address the issue and ensure the security and reliability of your application.
Actions you need to take will depend on the nature of the asset, your control over it, and the severity of the reported issue.

Here are some recommendations on what to do in such a situation:

 * Determine why the asset was flagged as malicious. It could be due to various factors, such as hosting malicious content, containing malware, spam, or being associated with a history of cyberattacks. Investigate the specifics of the problem.

 * Consider isolating it from your primary systems. You may want to temporarily disable or quarantine the asset to prevent further potential issues while you investigate.

 * If the asset is associated with a service you control, take steps to patch and secure it. This might involve updating software, implementing stronger security measures, and ensuring it is not used for malicious purposes.
