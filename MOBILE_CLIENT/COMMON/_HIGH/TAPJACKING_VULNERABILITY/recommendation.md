# Overlay Vulnerability

To mitigate Tapjacking vulnerabilities in mobile applications, developers should:

 * Implement robust security measures for mobile applications to mitigate overlay vulnerabilities.
 * Focus on enhancing settings and user interactions for increased security.
 * Thoroughly validate and filter user inputs and application settings to prevent exploitation by malicious overlays.
 * Pay special attention to sensitive settings vulnerable to manipulation by overlays, such as authentication parameters or access controls.
 * Implement strict input validation checks on user-modifiable settings to prevent unauthorized changes.
 * For settings related to user authentication or authorization, enforce strong authentication mechanisms and authorization controls.
 * Provide clear user guidance within the application on recognizing and avoiding suspicious overlays.
 * Regularly update the application to address newly identified vulnerabilities.
 * Consider implementing overlay detection mechanisms to enhance the application's resilience against potential threats.
 * On Android 6 (API level 23) and higher, users have to explicitly grant the permission for the app to create an overlay window.
 * On Android 12 (API level 31) and higher, apps can pass true into Window.setHideOverlayWindows().
