Obfuscation involves altering an application's binary code to render it more challenging for humans to comprehend. Obfuscation hides function and class names in your compiled Dart code, replacing each symbol with another symbol, making it difficult for an attacker to reverse engineer your proprietary app.

Adversaries can steal code and repurpose it and sell it in a new application or create a malicious fake application based on the initial one.

Obfuscating your code does not encrypt resources nor does it protect against reverse engineering. It only renames symbols with more obscure names.
