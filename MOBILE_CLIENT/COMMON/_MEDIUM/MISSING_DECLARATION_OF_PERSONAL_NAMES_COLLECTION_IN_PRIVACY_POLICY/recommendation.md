To mitigate the vulnerability of collecting users' personal names, ensure that your privacy policy clearly states the purpose for collecting this data, how it will be used, and how it will be protected. Additionally, provide users with the option to opt out of providing their personal names if they choose to do so. Regularly review and update your privacy policy to stay compliant with data protection regulations and maintain transparency with your users.
