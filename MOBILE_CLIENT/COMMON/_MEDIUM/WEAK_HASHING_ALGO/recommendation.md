Consider the following:

- **Avoid MD5 and SHA-1:** These algorithms are insecure and prone to collisions. They should not be used for any purpose, including HMAC.

- **For hashing prefer SHA-256 or SHA-3:** Opt for SHA-256 or SHA-3. They offer high security and are widely accepted industry standards.

- **For Passwords prefer Argon2 or Bcrypt:** For password hashing, consider Argon2 or Bcrypt. They are designed to resist brute-force attacks and are recommended by security standards.

- **Use HMAC with Secure Hash Algorithms:** When using HMAC for message authentication, ensure it's coupled with secure hash algorithms like SHA-256 or SHA-3 to maintain robust security.
