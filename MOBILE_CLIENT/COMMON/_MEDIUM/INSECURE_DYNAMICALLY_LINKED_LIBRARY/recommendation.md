When dealing with dynamic library loading, A developer should:
* Apply robust input validation and sanitization techniques to all input parameters used during library loading.
* Avoid loading libraries from untrusted or unknown sources.
* Employ digital signatures or cryptographic hashes to verify the authenticity and integrity of dynamically loaded libraries.
