When dealing with dynamic library loading, A developer should:
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent directory traversal and injection attacks.
* Only load libraries from trusted and verified sources, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the libraries.
* Enforce strict access controls to prevent unauthorized library loading.
* Regularly update and patch libraries to address known vulnerabilities.
* Employ strong code signing and integrity verification mechanisms to ensure the integrity of dynamically loaded libraries.
