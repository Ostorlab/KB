The application collects device or network information, such as IP addresses, device identifiers, operating system versions, or network details, but the privacy policy does not clearly disclose this. While some of this data is essential for app functionality or security, users should be informed about what is collected and why. Failure to disclose can be misleading and may violate privacy regulations if identifiers are linked to individuals.
