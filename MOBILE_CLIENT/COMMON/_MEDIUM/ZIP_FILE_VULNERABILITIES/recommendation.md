### Path Traversal
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent user-supplied input from containing directory traversal sequences.
- Use whitelisting or allowlisting approaches to validate and restrict input for file paths.
- Ensure that the extracted file paths are constructed based on trusted and validated information rather than relying solely on user-provided data.
- Restrict the extraction process to a specific directory or set of allowed directories.

### Zip Symbolic Link
- Before extracting files, check for symbolic links within the ZIP archive and ensure they are not followed blindly during extraction.
- Validate and sanitize the symbolic link target to prevent directory traversal or access to sensitive system files.
- Use platform-specific functions or libraries that handle symbolic links securely and prevent the creation of malicious links.
- Limit the extraction process to known-safe locations and avoid allowing symbolic links to be created outside of those boundaries.

### Zip Extension Spoofing
- Perform additional checks or validations on the extracted files to ensure that their true file type matches the expected extension.
- Consider using file signatures or magic numbers to verify the file's content and compare it with the indicated extension.
- Implement file type verification based on both the extension and the file header to ensure consistency.
- Consider using third-party libraries or tools specifically designed to handle ZIP files securely, as they may provide built-in protection against extension spoofing attacks.
