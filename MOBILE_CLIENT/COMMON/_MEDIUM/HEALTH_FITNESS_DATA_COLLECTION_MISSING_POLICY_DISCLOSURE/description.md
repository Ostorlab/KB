The application collects health or fitness data, such as medical information, activity levels, or dietary habits, but the privacy policy does not disclose this. Health and fitness data is considered a special category of personal information under regulations like GDPR and is highly sensitive. Failure to inform users about this collection is a significant issue and likely violates legal requirements for explicit consent and stringent data protection measures.
