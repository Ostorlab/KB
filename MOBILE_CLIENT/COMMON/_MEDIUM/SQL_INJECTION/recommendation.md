To mitigate Mobile SQL Injection vulnerabilities, it is crucial to implement several measures. Firstly, developers should adopt secure coding practices and input validation techniques to ensure that user inputs are properly sanitized and validated before being used in SQL queries. Additionally, the use of parameterized queries or prepared statements can help prevent SQL Injection attacks by separating SQL code from user input. It is also important to regularly update and patch mobile applications to address any known vulnerabilities. Lastly, implementing a robust web application firewall (WAF) can provide an additional layer of protection by detecting and blocking SQL Injection attempts.

### Code Examples:


=== "Kotlin"
  ```kotlin
  import java.sql.Connection
  import java.sql.DriverManager
  import java.sql.PreparedStatement
  import java.sql.ResultSet
  
  fun main() {
      val input = readLine() ?: ""
      val connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase", "username", "password")
      val statement = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?")
      statement.setString(1, sanitizeInput(input))
      val resultSet = statement.executeQuery()
  
      while (resultSet.next()) {
          val username = resultSet.getString("username")
          val password = resultSet.getString("password")
          println("Username: $username, Password: $password")
      }
  
      resultSet.close()
      statement.close()
      connection.close()
  }
  
  fun sanitizeInput(input: String): String {
      // Implement your input sanitization logic here
      // For example, you can use prepared statements or input validation libraries
      // to prevent SQL injection attacks
      return input
  }
  ```
