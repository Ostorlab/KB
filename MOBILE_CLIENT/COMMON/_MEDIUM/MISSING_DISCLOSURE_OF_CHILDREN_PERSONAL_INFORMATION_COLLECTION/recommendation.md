To mitigate the vulnerability of not mentioning what personal information is collected from children in your privacy policy, ensure that you clearly outline the types of data collected, how it is used, and how it is protected in a child-friendly and easily understandable manner. Additionally, consider obtaining parental consent before collecting any personal information from children to further protect their privacy.
