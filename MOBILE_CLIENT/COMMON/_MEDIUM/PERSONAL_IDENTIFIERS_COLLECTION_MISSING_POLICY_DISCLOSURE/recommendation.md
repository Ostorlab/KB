Update your application's privacy policy to explicitly list all types of personal identifiers collected (e.g., User ID, Device ID, IP Address, Advertising ID). For each identifier, clearly describe the specific purposes for its collection, how it is used, processed, stored, and its retention period. Ensure that all disclosures are transparent and comply with applicable data protection laws.
