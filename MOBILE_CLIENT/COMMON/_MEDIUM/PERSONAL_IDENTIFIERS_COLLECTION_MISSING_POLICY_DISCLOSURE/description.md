The application collects personal identifiers (such as User IDs, Device IDs, IP addresses, or Advertising IDs), but the privacy policy fails to adequately disclose the collection of these specific identifiers. This lack of transparency can prevent users from understanding how they are being tracked or identified, and may violate requirements under privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.
