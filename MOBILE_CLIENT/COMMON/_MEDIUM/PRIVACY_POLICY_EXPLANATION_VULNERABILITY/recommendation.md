To mitigate the vulnerability of not explaining why personal data is processed in your privacy policy, ensure that your policy clearly outlines the purposes for which personal data is collected, processed, and stored. This transparency helps build trust with users and demonstrates your commitment to protecting their privacy. Additionally, regularly review and update your privacy policy to reflect any changes in data processing practices.
