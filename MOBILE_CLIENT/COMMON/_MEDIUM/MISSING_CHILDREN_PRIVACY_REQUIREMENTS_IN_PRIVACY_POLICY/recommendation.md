To mitigate the vulnerability of not including information about requirements related to children in your privacy policy, ensure that you comply with relevant laws such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and clearly outline how you collect, use, and protect the personal information of children under the age of 13 in your privacy policy. Additionally, consider implementing age verification measures to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.
