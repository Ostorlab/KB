The application collects information for identity verification, such as images of government-issued IDs or verification selfies, but the privacy policy does not clearly disclose this. This type of data is highly sensitive and directly linked to an individual's legal identity. Failure to inform users about this collection can be misleading and may violate privacy regulations requiring explicit consent and stringent safeguards.
