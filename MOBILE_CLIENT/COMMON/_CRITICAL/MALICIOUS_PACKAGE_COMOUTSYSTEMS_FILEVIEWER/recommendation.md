#### Immediate Remediation Steps:

1.  **Isolate Affected Systems:**
    *   Disconnect any machine (developer workstations, build servers) where this package was built, installed, or run from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
    *   If deployed in an application, assess the scope of affected end-user devices if possible.

2.  **Remove the Malicious Package:**
    *   Identify all projects and applications that include `com.outsystems.plugins.fileviewer`.
    *   For Cordova projects, check `package.json`, `config.xml`, and inspect `assets/www/cordova_plugins.js` and related platform build files (e.g., in `platforms/android` or `platforms/ios`).
    *   Remove the dependency from your project's configuration (`package.json`, `config.xml`, etc.).
    *   Rebuild your application from a known clean environment after ensuring the package is no longer present.
    *   Thoroughly clean build caches and artifacts.

3.  **Credential Rotation (Critical):**
    *   From a **separate, trusted computer**, rotate ALL secrets and keys that were present on or accessible from the compromised system(s). This includes:
        *   Passwords (user, admin, service accounts)
        *   API keys and tokens
        *   SSH keys
        *   Encryption keys
        *   Database credentials
        *   Cloud provider credentials
        *   Version control system credentials

4.  **System Investigation and Sanitization:**
    *   Because an attacker may have achieved full control, simply removing the package is often insufficient.
    *   Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on affected systems to identify the extent of the compromise, any persistence mechanisms, and other malicious tools that may have been installed.
    *   Consider re-imaging affected developer workstations and build servers from a known good state.

5.  **Notify Affected Parties:**
    *   If customer data or end-user devices might be affected, follow your incident response plan for notification.

#### Preventative Measures for the Future:

1.  **Dependency Scanning:**
    *   Implement automated Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools in your CI/CD pipeline to scan for known vulnerabilities and malicious packages in your dependencies.
    *   Regularly update the databases for these tools.

2.  **Vet Dependencies:**
    *   Before adding a new dependency, research its reputation, maintainers, download statistics, and look for any reported security issues.
    *   Prefer well-maintained packages from trusted sources.

3.  **Pin Dependencies:**
    *   Use lockfiles (e.g., `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) to pin dependencies to specific, known-good versions. This prevents unintentional upgrades to potentially malicious newer versions.

4.  **Use Scoped Packages and Private Registries (If Applicable):**
    *   For internal packages, use scoped names and private registries to reduce the risk of substitution attacks (though this specific issue is a malicious package, not substitution).

5.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   Ensure build environments and developer workstations operate with the minimum necessary privileges.

6.  **Developer Education:**
    *   Train developers on the risks of software supply chain attacks and best practices for dependency management.

By taking these steps, organizations can respond to the immediate threat posed by `MAL-2022-2047` and strengthen their defenses against future malicious package incidents.
