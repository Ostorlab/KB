<p>This vulnerability exploits a shell command injection in the way "delegates" (commands for converting files) are
    processed in ImageMagick versions <= 7.0.1-0 and <= 6.9.3-9 (legacy). Since ImageMagick uses file magic to detect
    file format, you can create a .png (for example) which is actually a crafted SVG (for example) that triggers the
    command injection. Tested on Linux, BSD, and OS X. You will want to choose your payload carefully due to portability
    concerns. Use cmd/unix/generic if need be.Module type : exploit Rank : excellent Platforms : Unix</p>
