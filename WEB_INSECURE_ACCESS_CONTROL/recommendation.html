<p>Access control is only effective if enforced in trusted server-side
    code or server-less API, where the attacker cannot modify the
    access control check or metadata.</p>
<ul>
    <li>With the exception of public resources, deny by default.</li>
    l
    <li>Implement access control mechanisms once and re-use them throughout the application, including minimizing CORS
        usage.
    </li>
    <li>Model access controls should enforce record ownership, rather than accepting that the user can create, read,
        update, or delete any record.
    </li>
    <li>Unique application business limit requirements should be enforced by domain models.</li>
    <li>Disable web server directory listing and ensure file metadata (e.g. .git) and backup files are not present
        within web roots.
    </li>
    <li>Log access control failures, alert admins when appropriate (e.g. repeated failures).</li>
    <li>Rate limit API and controller access to minimize the harm from automated attack tooling.</li>
    <li>JWT tokens should be invalidated on the server after logout. Developers and QA staff should include functional
        access control unit and integration tests.
    </li>
</ul>
