<p>This entry describes all the logging API calls used to write log entries. <br>
    In Android, a logging mechanism called <code>Logcat</code> is introduced to view and filter series of circular buffers
    that contain logs from various applications and portions of the system. <br>Log information in <code>Logcat</code>
    can be read out from other applications in the same device. Thus, the output of sensitive information to
    <code>Logcat</code> is considered that it has a vulnerability of the information leakage.
