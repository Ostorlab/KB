<p>To output log messages to <code>LogCat</code> in a safe manner, pursue the following recommendations:
<ul>

  <li>Sensitive information must not be included in operation log information. Construct the build system to Auto-delete codes which output development log information: For example, <code>Log.d()</code>
  and <code>Log.v()</code> should be deleted when building an application for release. ProGuard is a tool that can automatically
    delete them by specifying <code>Log.d()</code> and <code>Log(v)</code> as parameter of <code>-assumenosideeffects</code> option. </li>


  <li>Use <code>Log.d()</code> or <code>Log.v()</code> when Outputting throwable Objects: When exceptions occur, stack trace is often
    output to <code>LogCat</code> by <code>Log.e()</code>, <code>Log.w()</code> or <code>Log.i()</code> methods. Thus, detail internal structure can be shown.
  For example, when SQLiteException is output as it is, type of SQL statement is revealed and it may give a
    clue for SQL injection attack.</li>

  <li>Use only Methods of the <code>android.util.Log</code> class for Log Output. </li>
  <li>Do not output by <code>print()</code> or <code>println()</code> method of <code>System.out</code> and <code>System.err</code> class since log information and development
  log information are output by the same  method and it fosters the danger of dropped deletion by oversight.
    Moreover, using both <code>android.util.Log</code> and <code>System.out/err</code> will increase considered needs and, as a result,
  the danger of occurring mistakes will increase.</li>
  <li>Choose the right log level based on the information criticity.</li>

</ul>
