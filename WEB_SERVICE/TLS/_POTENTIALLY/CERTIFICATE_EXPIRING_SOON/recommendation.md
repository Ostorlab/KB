To mitigate the risks associated with certificates that are expiring soon, consider the following:

- Implement automated monitoring with alerts set at 90, 60, and 30 days before expiration.
- Establish a documented process for certificate renewal, involving all responsible parties.
- Use automated tools, such as ACME (Automated Certificate Management Environment), for certificate renewal and issuance.
