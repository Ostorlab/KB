To mitigate the risks associated with the Raccoon Attack, organizations should implement the following strategies:

1. **Disable Reuse of Diffie-Hellman Key Shares:** Ensure that each SSL/TLS session generates unique Diffie-Hellman keys to prevent attackers from exploiting key reuse across sessions.

2. **Use Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC):** Adopt elliptic-curve-based key exchanges (such as ECDHE) which are less vulnerable to timing attacks and offer stronger security with shorter keys.

3. **Apply TLS 1.3:** Upgrade to TLS 1.3 where feasible, as it uses more secure cryptographic algorithms and enforces forward secrecy, mitigating timing attacks like Raccoon.

4. **Reduce Timing Discrepancies:** Implement constant-time cryptographic operations for key exchanges to minimize timing variations that could be exploited in side-channel attacks.

5. **Patch and Update SSL/TLS Implementations:** Regularly update cryptographic libraries, such as OpenSSL, to the latest stable versions (e.g., OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later) where the Raccoon vulnerability has been patched or mitigated. Also, ensure that TLS stacks and software components are updated to the latest releases that address this and other potential vulnerabilities.

By following these steps, organizations can significantly reduce their exposure to the Raccoon Attack and strengthen the security of their SSL/TLS implementations.
