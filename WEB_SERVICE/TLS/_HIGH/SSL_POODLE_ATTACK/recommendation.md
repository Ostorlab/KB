To mitigate POODLE attacks:

**Primary Defense - Disable SSL 3.0:**

```nginx
# Nginx configuration
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
# Apache configuration
SSLProtocol -all +TLSv1.2 +TLSv1.3
```

**Implement TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV:**

* Prevents protocol downgrade attacks
* Supported in OpenSSL 1.0.1j+ and modern TLS libraries
* Allows safe fallback without forcing SSL 3.0

**Browser Protection:**

* Modern browsers disable SSL 3.0 by default
* Ensure browsers are up-to-date
* Consider implementing Content Security Policy

**Alternative Mitigations (if SSL 3.0 required):**

* Disable CBC cipher suites in SSL 3.0
* Implement anti-POODLE record splitting
* Use only RC4 ciphers

By completely disabling SSL 3.0 and implementing TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV, organizations eliminate POODLE attack vectors while maintaining secure encrypted communications.
