To address weak key vulnerabilities:

1. **Use Adequate Key Lengths:**
   - For RSA and DSA, use a minimum key length of 2048 bits.
   - Consider using 3072 bits or higher for long-term security.

2. **Consider Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC):**
   - ECC provides equivalent security with shorter key lengths, offering better performance.
   - Use curves like P-256 or P-384 for strong security.

3. **Regular Key Rotation:**
   - Implement a policy to regularly rotate keys, especially when upgrading to stronger key lengths.

4. **Audit Existing Certificates:**
   - Regularly audit your SSL/TLS certificates to identify and replace any with weak keys.

5. **Use Modern Certificate Authorities:**
   - Choose CAs that enforce strong key requirements and follow industry best practices.

6. **Implement Strong Key Generation Practices:**
   - Use cryptographically secure random number generators when generating keys.
   - Consider using hardware security modules (HSMs) for key generation and storage.
