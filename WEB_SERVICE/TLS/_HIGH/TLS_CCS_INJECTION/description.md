This vulnerability indicates that the server is susceptible to CCS injection attacks, which exploit improper handling of ChangeCipherSpec messages in OpenSSL to force the use of weak encryption keys during TLS handshakes.

CCS (ChangeCipherSpec) injection occurs when OpenSSL accepts CCS messages out of order, before the master secret has been properly established. This causes the system to generate encryption keys using an empty master secret instead of the actual negotiated secret, resulting in weak, predictable keys.

### How It Works:
1. Attacker intercepts TLS handshake after ServerHello but before master secret generation
2. Malicious CCS message is injected into both client and server connections
3. Both endpoints generate session keys using empty master secret (all zeros)
4. Attacker can decrypt all subsequent traffic using the predictable weak keys

### Requirements:
- Both client and server must use vulnerable OpenSSL versions
- Man-in-the-middle network access capability
- OpenSSL 1.0.1+ servers are particularly exploitable

**Example Scenario:**
A web application uses OpenSSL 1.0.1g on both client and server. An attacker on the same network injects CCS messages during the TLS handshake, forcing both sides to use encryption keys derived from an empty master secret. The attacker can then decrypt all HTTPS traffic, including login credentials and session cookies.

The vulnerability existed in OpenSSL for over 15 years before discovery, affecting virtually all SSL/TLS connections using vulnerable OpenSSL versions and enabling complete session compromise.
