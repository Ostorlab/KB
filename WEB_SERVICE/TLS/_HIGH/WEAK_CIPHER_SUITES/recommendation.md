To address the risks associated with weak cipher suites, consider implementing the following recommendations:

1. **Disable Weak Cipher Suites:**
   - Remove support for all weak cipher suites, including RC4, 3DES, NULL ciphers, EXPORT grade ciphers, and those using MD5.
   - Disable anonymous key exchange methods (ADH, AECDH).

2. **Enable Strong Cipher Suites:**
   - Use strong cipher suites that support Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).
   - Prefer ECDHE or DHE for key exchange.
   - Use AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 for encryption.
   - Ensure message authentication uses SHA-256 or better.

3. **Prioritize Cipher Suites:**
   - Order cipher suites to prefer the strongest and most secure options.
   - Follow recommendations from reputable sources like Mozilla's SSL Configuration Generator.

4. **Implement Secure TLS Configuration:**
   - Use TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 (preferred).
   - Disable TLS compression to prevent CRIME attacks.
   - Enable OCSP stapling for efficient certificate validation.

5. **Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):**
   - Use HSTS to ensure clients always connect using HTTPS, preventing downgrade attacks.
