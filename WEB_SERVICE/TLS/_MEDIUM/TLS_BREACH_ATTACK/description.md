This vulnerability indicates that the server is susceptible to BREACH attacks, which exploit HTTP compression to extract sensitive information from encrypted HTTPS responses by measuring compressed response sizes.

BREACH (Browser Reconnaissance and Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression of Hypertext) occurs when secrets (CSRF tokens, session data) and user input appear in the same compressed HTTP response. Compression algorithms create detectable patterns that reveal information about the secret.

### How It Works:
1. Malicious JavaScript makes requests to target site using victim's cookies
2. Attacker injects guesses via URL parameters or form data  
3. When the guess matches part of a secret, the response compresses better (smaller size)
4. By measuring response sizes, attacker extracts secrets incrementally

### Requirements:
- HTTP compression enabled (gzip/deflate)
- User input reflected in HTTP response bodies
- Secrets in the same responses as user input
- Multiple requests allowed

**Example Scenario:**
A web application includes a CSRF token in a JSON response along with user-provided search terms. An attacker crafts requests with different search terms that partially match the CSRF token pattern, observing compressed response sizes to gradually extract the entire token.

The attack can extract secrets with thousands of requests in under a minute, leading to session hijacking, CSRF bypass, and exposure of sensitive data.
