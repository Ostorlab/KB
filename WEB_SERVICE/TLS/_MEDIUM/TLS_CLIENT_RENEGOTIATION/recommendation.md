To mitigate TLS client-initiated renegotiation vulnerabilities, implement the following strategies:

**Primary Mitigations:**

1. **Disable Client-Initiated Renegotiation** - The most effective mitigation is to completely disable client-initiated renegotiation while still allowing server-initiated renegotiation when necessary.

2. **Implement Renegotiation Rate Limiting** - If client renegotiation cannot be disabled, implement strict rate limiting on how frequently a client can request renegotiation.

3. **Update TLS Libraries** - Ensure all TLS implementations are updated to include protections against renegotiation-based DoS attacks.

**Implementation Examples:**

```nginx
# Nginx configuration
# Disable client renegotiation
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
```

```apache
# Apache configuration
# Disable client renegotiation while keeping server renegotiation
SSLProtocol -all +TLSv1.2 +TLSv1.3
SSLOptions +NoRenegotiate
```

```openssl
# OpenSSL configuration (for custom applications)
SSL_CTX_set_options(ctx, SSL_OP_NO_CLIENT_RENEGOTIATION);
```

**For Load Balancers:**

```
# F5 BIG-IP configuration
modify ltm profile client-ssl my_ssl_profile {
    renegotiation disabled
}
```

**Additional Safeguards:**

* Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block excessive renegotiation requests
* Implement connection and request rate limiting at the network level
* Consider upgrading to TLS 1.3 which eliminates renegotiation completely
* Configure network timeout policies to close connections that attempt excessive renegotiation

**Verifying Your Configuration:**

```bash
# Test for client renegotiation using OpenSSL
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -tls1_2
# Then type "R" and press Enter to request renegotiation
# If the connection terminates or returns an error, client renegotiation is disabled
```
