This vulnerability indicates that the server allows unlimited client-initiated TLS renegotiation, which can be exploited for denial-of-service attacks by forcing the server to perform expensive cryptographic operations.

Client-initiated renegotiation vulnerability occurs when TLS servers allow clients to repeatedly request renegotiation of TLS parameters without adequate rate limiting. Since the server must perform computationally expensive cryptographic operations during renegotiation, this can be exploited to consume server resources with minimal attacker effort.

### How It Works:
1. Attacker establishes a TLS connection to the target server
2. Attacker repeatedly triggers TLS renegotiation requests (potentially thousands per second)
3. Server's CPU becomes saturated processing these renegotiation handshakes
4. Legitimate users experience severe performance degradation or complete service unavailability

### Requirements:
- TLS server allowing client-initiated renegotiation
- Absence of rate limiting or throttling on renegotiation attempts
- Ability to establish a connection to the target server

**Example Scenario:**
An attacker establishes a small number of connections to a banking website's HTTPS server, then initiates hundreds of renegotiation requests per second on each connection. The server's CPU utilization spikes to 100% as it processes these cryptographic operations, causing legitimate transactions to time out or fail completely. With just a few attack connections, the attacker achieves an effective denial of service using minimal bandwidth.

The attack exploits the computational asymmetry between client and server during TLS renegotiation, where the server must perform significantly more work than the client. This makes it a particularly efficient DoS vector that can affect any service using TLS, including HTTPS, SMTP over TLS, and other secure protocols.
