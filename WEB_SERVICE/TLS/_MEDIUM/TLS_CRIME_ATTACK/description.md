This vulnerability indicates that the server is susceptible to CRIME attacks, which exploit TLS compression to extract sensitive information like authentication cookies through compression ratio analysis.

CRIME (Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy) occurs when TLS connections use DEFLATE compression, which eliminates duplicate strings to reduce bandwidth. Attackers exploit this by injecting controlled data that matches parts of secret information, observing how compression affects the encrypted payload size.

### How It Works:
1. Attacker forces victim's browser to make HTTPS requests to target website
2. Malicious requests contain guesses that partially match secret cookie values
3. When guesses match actual cookie content, compression reduces payload size
4. Attacker measures encrypted request lengths to determine correct guesses
5. Process repeats byte-by-byte until entire cookie is extracted

### Requirements:
- Both client and server must support TLS DEFLATE compression
- Man-in-the-middle network position to observe traffic
- Ability to inject JavaScript or control victim's requests
- Target secrets must appear in compressed request data

**Example Scenario:**
A user connects to a banking website over public WiFi. An attacker injects JavaScript that makes thousands of HTTPS requests with cookie guesses like "sessionid=a", "sessionid=b", etc. When the guess matches the real session cookie, DEFLATE compression recognizes the duplicate string and creates a smaller payload. By measuring encrypted sizes, the attacker extracts the complete session cookie in minutes.

The vulnerability affects older browsers (Chrome/Firefox pre-2012) that supported TLS compression, allowing complete session hijacking and unauthorized account access through compression oracle attacks.
