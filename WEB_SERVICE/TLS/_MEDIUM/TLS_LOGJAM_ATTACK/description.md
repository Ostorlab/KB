This vulnerability indicates that the server is susceptible to LOGJAM attacks, which exploit weak Diffie-Hellman parameters to downgrade TLS connections to breakable export-grade cryptography.

LOGJAM occurs when TLS servers support DHE_EXPORT cipher suites or use weak 512-bit Diffie-Hellman parameters. Man-in-the-middle attackers can force clients to downgrade from strong DHE key exchange to weak export-grade DH, making the encryption vulnerable to offline cryptanalysis.

### How It Works:
1. Attacker intercepts TLS handshake between client and server
2. Forces downgrade from strong DHE ciphers to weak DHE_EXPORT (512-bit)
3. Captures the downgraded connection with weak DH parameters
4. Uses precomputed discrete logarithm tables to break 512-bit DH offline
5. Recovers session keys and decrypts all captured traffic

### Requirements:
- Server supports DHE_EXPORT cipher suites or weak DH parameters
- Man-in-the-middle network position to force downgrade
- Precomputed number field sieve tables for common DH primes
- Client vulnerable to protocol downgrade attacks

**Example Scenario:**
A corporate VPN server supports legacy DHE_EXPORT ciphers for compatibility. An attacker on the network intercepts employee connections and forces downgrade to 512-bit DH parameters. Using precomputed cryptographic tables (costing ~$18,000 to generate), the attacker breaks the weak DH exchange in hours and decrypts all VPN traffic, exposing corporate credentials and sensitive data.

The attack exploits the same 1990s export restrictions as FREAK, demonstrating how government-mandated crypto weakening created lasting vulnerabilities in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol used by millions of servers worldwide.
