To mitigate the risks associated with outdated SSL/TLS protocols, consider the following recommendations:

1. **Disable Outdated Protocols:**
   - Disable support for SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1.0, and TLSv1.1 on all servers and applications.
   - Enable only TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3, which are currently considered secure.

2. **Update SSL/TLS Libraries:**
   - Ensure all SSL/TLS libraries and implementations are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
   - Consider using modern TLS libraries that have secure defaults and are actively maintained.

3. **Configure Strong Cipher Suites:**
   - Use strong cipher suites that support Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).
   - Disable weak ciphers and hash functions (e.g., RC4, MD5, SHA1).

4. **Implement Secure TLS Configuration:**
   - Follow industry best practices for TLS configuration, such as those provided by Mozilla's SSL Configuration Generator or OWASP's TLS Cheat Sheet.
   - Regularly test your TLS configuration using tools like SSL Labs' SSL Server Test.

5. **Use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):**
   - Implement HSTS to ensure that clients always connect to your server using HTTPS, preventing downgrade attacks.

6. **Consider TLS 1.3:**
   - If possible, enable support for TLS 1.3, which offers improved security and performance over TLS 1.2.
