To mitigate Ticketbleed attacks:

**Primary Defense - Update F5 TMOS:**

Upgrade to patched F5 BIG-IP versions:
- 11.6.0 HF6 or later
- 12.0.0 HF4 or later  
- 12.1.0 HF1 or later
- 13.0.0 or later

**Immediate Mitigation - Disable Session Tickets:**

If immediate patching is not possible, disable session tickets on affected SSL profiles:

```bash
# Via F5 CLI
tmsh modify ltm profile client-ssl [profile-name] options none

# Via F5 Web Interface
Local Traffic > Profiles > SSL > Client > [Profile] > Configuration > Options
Remove "Session Ticket" from enabled options
```

**Testing for Vulnerability:**

```bash
# Test with custom session ID length
openssl s_client -connect target:443 -sess_out session.pem
openssl s_client -connect target:443 -sess_in session.pem -msg

# Check SSL Labs test results
curl "https://api.ssllabs.com/api/v3/analyze?host=target.com"
```

**Detection and Monitoring:**

* Monitor for unusual session ID patterns in TLS handshakes
* Look for connections with non-standard session ID lengths (not 32 bytes)
* F5 devices log session ticket usage when debug logging is enabled

This vulnerability only affects F5 BIG-IP appliances with session tickets explicitly enabled. Standard web browsers are not affected as they use 32-byte session IDs by default.
