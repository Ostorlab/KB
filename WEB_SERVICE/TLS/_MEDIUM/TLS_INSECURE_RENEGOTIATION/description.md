This vulnerability indicates that the server does not support secure renegotiation as defined in RFC 5746, leaving it vulnerable to plaintext injection attacks during TLS handshake renegotiation.

TLS renegotiation allows changing connection parameters during an active session. The original TLS specification failed to cryptographically bind renegotiation handshakes to existing connections, creating a security flaw where attackers can inject data into encrypted sessions.

### How It Works:
1. Attacker establishes TLS connection to target server and injects malicious requests
2. Legitimate client attempts to connect to the same server  
3. Attacker splices the client's handshake as a "renegotiation" of their existing session
4. Server processes attacker's initial data in the context of the authenticated client

### Requirements:
- Server supports TLS renegotiation without RFC 5746
- Man-in-the-middle network position 
- Application protocols that don't distinguish pre/post-authentication data

**Example Scenario:**
An attacker on public WiFi intercepts banking connections, establishes a TLS session, and sends unauthorized transfer requests. When the victim authenticates, the server processes the malicious transfers as legitimate requests from the authenticated user.

This affects HTTPS, SMTP over TLS, and other TLS-protected protocols, potentially leading to unauthorized transactions, data theft, and account compromise.
