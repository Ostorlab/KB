This vulnerability indicates that the server is susceptible to BEAST attacks, which exploit predictable initialization vectors in TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0 CBC mode encryption to recover plaintext data through blockwise chosen boundary attacks.

BEAST (Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS) occurs when TLS 1.0 or SSL 3.0 implementations use the last ciphertext block as the initialization vector for the next record, making encryption predictable. Attackers can exploit this through JavaScript-based chosen plaintext injection to guess secrets one byte at a time.

### How It Works:
1. Attacker establishes man-in-the-middle position on network traffic
2. Malicious JavaScript injects chosen plaintext with controlled block boundaries
3. Predictable initialization vectors allow verification of guessed bytes
4. Gradual extraction of sensitive data like session cookies and CSRF tokens

### Requirements:
- TLS 1.0 or SSL 3.0 with CBC cipher suites
- Man-in-the-middle network access
- JavaScript execution capability in the victim's browser
- Same-origin requests to the target application

**Example Scenario:**
A web application uses TLS 1.0 with AES-CBC encryption. An attacker on the same network injects JavaScript that makes thousands of crafted HTTPS requests, exploiting predictable IVs to guess session cookie values one byte at a time. The extracted session cookie allows complete account impersonation.

The attack demonstrates fundamental weaknesses in older TLS implementations, leading to session hijacking, authentication bypass, and potential regulatory compliance violations.
