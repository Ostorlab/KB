DNSSEC adds cryptographic signatures to existing DNS records, allowing resolvers to verify the authenticity and integrity of DNS responses. When DNSSEC is missing or misconfigured, it can lead to:

1. Lack of origin authentication for DNS data
2. Inability to ensure data integrity of DNS responses
3. Increased susceptibility to man-in-the-middle attacks
4. Potential for malicious redirection of network traffic

The absence or misconfiguration of DNSSEC can have significant consequences.
Attackers may gain the ability to intercept and manipulate DNS queries, potentially redirecting users to fraudulent websites that mimic legitimate services.
This can lead to various malicious activities, including credential theft, malware distribution, or service disruption.
Additionally, if such attacks occur or become known, it can result in a loss of trust in the domain's online services, potentially damaging the organization's reputation and user confidence.
