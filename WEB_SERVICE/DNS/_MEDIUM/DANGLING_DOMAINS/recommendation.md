To mitigate the risks associated with dangling domains, consider the following recommendations:

- **Start with Domain Inventory:** Begin with a comprehensive audit of all domains and subdomains:
  ```bash
  # Example Domain Inventory Format
  domain: example.com
  subdomains:
    - app.example.com -> AWS CloudFront
    - api.example.com -> Azure App Service
    - mail.example.com -> Google Workspace
  owner: DevOps Team
  ```

- **Implement Progressive Monitoring Levels:** Scale monitoring based on domain criticality:
  | Domain Type          | Check Frequency | Reason                          |
  |---------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
  | Production Critical | Every 5 min     | Business-critical services      |
  | Customer Facing     | Every 15 min    | Customer experience impact      |
  | Internal Tools      | Every hour      | Internal operations support     |
  | Development         | Every 6 hours   | Non-critical environments       |

- **Regular Domain Auditing:**
  * Validate all cloud resource connections
  * Check third-party service dependencies
  * Verify DNS record accuracy
  * Monitor subdomain certificates

- **Security Best Practices:**
  * Use dedicated cloud credentials for DNS management
  * Implement strict RBAC for DNS changes
  * Enable audit logging for all DNS modifications
  * Maintain DNS change approval workflows

- **Operational Procedures:**
  * Document all domain ownership details
  * Create service decommissioning checklists
  * Maintain cloud resource mapping
  * Test domain takeover prevention measures

- **Planned Decommissioning Strategy:**
  1. Start with resource identification
  2. Document all dependencies
  3. Monitor for active connections
  4. Remove DNS records
  5. Archive configuration details

These recommendations help ensure proper domain management and prevent dangling domain vulnerabilities while maintaining operational efficiency.
