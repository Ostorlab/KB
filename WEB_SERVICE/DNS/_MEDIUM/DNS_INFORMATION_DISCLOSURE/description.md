DNS Information Disclosure vulnerabilities occur when DNS records expose sensitive information that can be used to gather insights into an organization's infrastructure. Attackers may exploit exposed DNS data, such as private IP addresses, API keys, internal hostnames, or other sensitive content, to launch targeted attacks.

**How It Works:**

Attackers analyze DNS records, such as A, AAAA, SRV, or TXT records, to identify sensitive information. Some of the common exposures include:

- **Private IP Addresses**: Internal IP addresses exposed via DNS records may reveal internal network structures.
- **API Keys and Passwords**: Sensitive information, like API keys or passwords, can sometimes be unintentionally published in TXT records.
- **Internal Hostnames**: Exposing internal hostnames or domains can help attackers plan internal network attacks or phishing schemes.

Risks of Not Addressing DNS Information Disclosure:
- **Increased Attack Surface**: Exposed DNS information gives attackers a clearer view of the target, making it easier to plan attacks.
- **Data Confidentiality Risks**: Sensitive information, if exposed, can lead to unauthorized access or data leakage.
- **Social Engineering and Phishing**: Attackers can leverage disclosed information to create convincing phishing campaigns or exploit internal systems.
