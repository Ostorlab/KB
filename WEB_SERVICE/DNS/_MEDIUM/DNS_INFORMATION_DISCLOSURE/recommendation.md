To mitigate DNS Information Disclosure vulnerabilities, implement the following recommendations:
 
- **Review and Clean DNS Entries**: Regularly audit DNS entries, ensuring sensitive data (like internal IP addresses or hostnames) is not exposed.
- **Use DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)**: Implement DNSSEC to add security layers to DNS queries and prevent tampering of DNS records.
- **Minimize Data in DNS TXT Records**: Avoid placing sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) in DNS TXT records, and review existing records for inadvertent exposure.
