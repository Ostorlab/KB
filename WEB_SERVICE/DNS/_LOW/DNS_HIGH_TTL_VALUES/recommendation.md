To mitigate the risk associated with High TTL values, consider the following recommendations:

- **Use Moderately Short TTL Values:** Set TTL values to a moderate length (e.g., 300 to 3600 seconds) for critical DNS records like web servers, load balancers, or email servers, to balance performance and flexibility.
- **Regularly Monitor DNS Records**: Periodically audit TTL values across your DNS records to ensure they are optimized for current needs.  
- **Security Measures:** Ensure that your DNS servers are secured against cache poisoning and other attacks. Implement DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) to enhance the integrity of DNS responses.
- **Adjust TTL for Planned Changes**: Before major DNS changes, lower TTL values temporarily to ensure rapid propagation of updates.

TTL Use Cases and Examples:

| Use Case              | TTL Setting  | Reason                          |
|-----------------------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| Web page content       | 300 seconds  | Frequently dynamic              |
| API responses          | 60 seconds   | Data changes often              |
| Load balancer records  | 60 seconds   | Machines go in/out of service    |
| Website analytics      | 5 minutes    | Frequently updated              |
