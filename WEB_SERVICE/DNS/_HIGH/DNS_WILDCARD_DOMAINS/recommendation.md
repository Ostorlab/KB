To mitigate the risks associated with DNS wildcard domains, consider implementing the following measures:

1. **Avoid Using Wildcard Domains Where Unnecessary:** Use specific subdomains instead of wildcard entries wherever possible to reduce the attack surface.
2. **Subdomain Monitoring:** Regularly monitor the creation and use of subdomains under your domain to detect any unauthorized or suspicious activity.
3. **Limit Subdomain Access:** Implement access controls for subdomains to ensure only authorized users or services can create and manage them.
4. **Implement DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC):** DNSSEC can help ensure the authenticity of DNS responses and mitigate certain attacks, such as DNS spoofing.
5. **Use Certificate Pinning:** Enforce strict certificate pinning policies for subdomains to prevent phishing attacks using rogue certificates.
6. **Audit and Review DNS Configuration:** Regularly audit DNS configurations to ensure that wildcard entries are not present unless absolutely necessary.
7. **Set Up Alerts for Subdomain Creation:** Implement alerts for subdomain creation or changes in DNS records, allowing you to detect suspicious or unintended configurations early.
