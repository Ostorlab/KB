Sender Policy Framework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC), and Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) are key DNS records used to authenticate email and prevent spoofing.

- **SPF:** Ensures that only authorized mail servers can send emails on behalf of a domain.
- **DKIM:** Allows the recipient to verify the sender and the message integrity via a digital signature.
- **DMARC:** Aligns SPF and DKIM to provide reporting and a policy for handling unauthenticated emails.
- **BIMI:** Adds brand logos to verified emails, improving brand recognition and trust in email communications.

Failure to properly configure these records can result in increased vulnerability to phishing attacks, email spoofing, and a reduction in email deliverability. Each check ensures that email authentication mechanisms are correctly implemented.
