This information entry aids in identifying Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities by providing a comprehensive catalog of traversed paths within GraphQL. By examining the various queried resources and potential paths leading to these resources, you can pinpoint areas where authorization should be implemented but may have been overlooked. This systematic approach enhances the detection of potential security gaps in GraphQL implementations.
