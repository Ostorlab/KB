Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature enforced through HTTP headers that enables a web client to securely request resources from a server on a different domain. To maintain strict security standards, the application implements a secure CORS policy by allowing requests only from trusted origins. This is achieved by specifying a whitelist of approved domains, effectively mitigating the risk of unauthorized access and potential attacks.

**Key Features of the CORS Implementation:**

1. **Origin Control**: CORS allows servers to specify which domains are permitted to access their resources using the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. This prevents unauthorized cross-domain access.

2. **Preflight Requests**: For certain HTTP methods or custom headers, browsers send a preflight `OPTIONS` request before the actual request. This checks if the server allows the intended method and headers with the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` headers.

3. **Allowed HTTP Methods**: The server can specify which HTTP methods (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc.) are permitted using the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` header.

4. **Allowed Headers**: Servers can declare which request headers can be used in the actual request with the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` header.

5. **Credentials Support**: CORS can handle credentials (cookies, HTTP authentication) by using the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header, enabling servers to allow or block credentials in cross-origin requests.

6. **Caching of Preflight Responses**: Servers can specify how long the results of a preflight request can be cached using the `Access-Control-Max-Age` header, reducing the number of preflight requests sent.

7. **Exposed Response Headers**: The server can explicitly specify which response headers can be accessed by the browser using the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header.

This secure implementation of CORS ensures that users can interact with the application without exposing sensitive information to malicious actors.
