**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Overview**

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented via HTTP headers that allows a web client to securely request resources from a server located on a different domain. This mechanism enables controlled access to resources while maintaining strict security standards.

**Secure CORS Implementation**

The application implements a secure CORS policy that only allows requests from trusted origins. By specifying a whitelist of approved domains, the application effectively mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and potential attacks.

**Key Features of the CORS Implementation:**

1. **Restrictive Origin Policy**: Only trusted domains are allowed to access the resources, preventing unauthorized domains from making requests.
2. **Limited HTTP Methods**: The application only supports necessary HTTP methods (e.g., `GET`, `POST`), reducing the attack surface.
3. **CSRF Protections**: The implementation includes protections against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), ensuring that state-changing requests are validated.
4. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring and logging are in place to detect any unusual activity related to CORS requests.

This secure implementation of CORS ensures that users can interact with the application without exposing sensitive information to malicious actors.
