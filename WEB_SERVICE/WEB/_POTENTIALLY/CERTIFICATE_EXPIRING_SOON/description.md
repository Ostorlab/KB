SSL/TLS certificates nearing their expiration date pose a critical risk to service continuity and security. Certificates that are set to expire within the next 30 days require immediate attention to avoid disruptions.

Key Points:

- Approaching Expiration: Certificates within 30 days of expiration need proactive monitoring to prevent service interruptions.
- User Trust: Browsers may display warnings for certificates close to expiring, which can erode user trust and drive visitors away.
- Compliance Risks: Many regulatory standards mandate up-to-date SSL/TLS certificates for compliance, and neglecting expiring certificates can result in non-compliance.
