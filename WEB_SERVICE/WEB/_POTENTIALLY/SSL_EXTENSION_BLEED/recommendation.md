To mitigate the risks of SSL Extension Bleed:

- **Upgrade SSL/TLS Libraries:** Regularly update SSL/TLS libraries (e.g., OpenSSL, BoringSSL, GnuTLS) to the latest versions. Test the application after each upgrade to ensure compatibility and functionality.

- **Implement Strong Cipher Suites:** Configure your server to prioritize strong cipher suites like AES-GCM or ChaCha20 and disable weak ones (e.g., RC4, DES, 3DES). Use tools like SSL Labs' SSL Test to review and improve your SSL/TLS configuration regularly.
