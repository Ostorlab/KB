To mitigate the risks associated with SSL Extension Bleed, consider the following:

- **Upgrade SSL/TLS Libraries:**

    - **Action:** Regularly check for updates and patches for all SSL/TLS libraries (e.g., OpenSSL, BoringSSL, GnuTLS).

    - **Best Practice:** Set up an automated system for monitoring and applying security updates. Utilize package managers that provide notifications for updates. 
    
    - **Validation:** After upgrading, test your application to ensure compatibility and functionality with the new library versions.

- **Implement Strong Cipher Suites:** 
  
  - **Action:** Configure your server to prioritize strong cipher suites, such as those based on AES-GCM or ChaCha20, and disable weak ones (e.g., RC4, DES, 3DES).

  - **Best Practice:** Use tools like SSL Labs' SSL Test to evaluate your server's SSL/TLS configuration and receive recommendations for improving security.

  - **Validation:** Regularly review the configuration of your web servers, load balancers, and any proxies handling SSL/TLS to ensure compliance with best practices.
