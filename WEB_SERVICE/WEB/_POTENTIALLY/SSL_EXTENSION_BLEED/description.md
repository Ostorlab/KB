The application is detected to be vulnerable to SSL Extension Bleed, a type of vulnerability that exploits improper handling of SSL/TLS extensions during the handshake process.

SSL Extension Bleed can lead to the exposure of sensitive information, including plaintext data from previous connections, session keys, or even private keys. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability in the following ways:

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from memory, such as SSL session keys or plaintext data previously transmitted over the same SSL connection. This poses a significant risk, especially if sensitive user data is exposed.

- **Session Hijacking:** If session keys are disclosed, attackers can potentially hijack existing SSL sessions, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts or sensitive data.
