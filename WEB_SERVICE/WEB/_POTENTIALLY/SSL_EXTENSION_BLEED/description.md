SSL Extension Bleed is a vulnerability that exploits improper handling of SSL/TLS extensions during the handshake process. It can lead to the exposure of sensitive information, such as plaintext data from previous connections, session keys, or even private keys.

This vulnerability allows attackers to:

- **Extract Sensitive Information:** Attackers can access data stored in memory, potentially revealing SSL session keys or plaintext data transmitted over earlier SSL connections.

- **Hijack Sessions:** If session keys are disclosed, attackers may gain unauthorized access to existing SSL sessions, allowing them to access user accounts or sensitive information without permission.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a web server that supports SSL/TLS and allows a specific extension, such as `SessionTicket TLS`, to optimize session resumption during the handshake process. However, due to improper memory management or a flaw in the handling of these extensions, some sensitive data from previous SSL sessions (such as session keys or portions of plaintext data) remains in memory.

An attacker who can repeatedly initiate SSL/TLS handshakes may craft malicious SSL extensions or probe the server in a way that causes the server to unintentionally leak data from memory during the handshake. As a result, the attacker might recover session keys used in earlier connections, which could then be used to decrypt previously encrypted communication or hijack active user sessions.

In this scenario, the exposure occurs because the server fails to clear memory buffers used by the SSL/TLS extensions, making it possible for attackers to extract information that should have been securely wiped.
