SSL Extension Bleed is a vulnerability that exploits improper handling of SSL/TLS extensions during the handshake process. It can lead to the exposure of sensitive information, such as plaintext data from previous connections, session keys, or even private keys.

This vulnerability allows attackers to:

- **Extract Sensitive Information:** Attackers can access data stored in memory, potentially revealing SSL session keys or plaintext data transmitted over earlier SSL connections.

- **Hijack Sessions:** If session keys are disclosed, attackers may gain unauthorized access to existing SSL sessions, allowing them to access user accounts or sensitive information without permission.
