## Best Practices for Mitigation

1. Implement Consistent Server-Side Authorization:
   - Use middleware or decorators to enforce access controls uniformly.
   - Example:
     ```python
     @require_permission('admin')
     def resolve_sensitive_data(self, info):
         # Only admins can access this resolver
         pass
     ```

2. Utilize Field-Level Permissions:
   - Define and enforce access controls at the field level.
   - Example using graphene-django:
     ```python
     class UserType(DjangoObjectType):
         class Meta:
             model = User
             fields = ('id', 'username', 'email')
         
         @staticmethod
         def resolve_email(parent, info):
             if info.context.user.has_permission('view_email'):
                 return parent.email
             return None
     ```

3. Use Custom Scalars for Sensitive Data:
   - Implement custom scalar types with built-in authorization checks.

4. Disable or Limit Introspection:
   - In production environments, disable introspection or limit it to authenticated and authorized users only.

5. Regular Security Audits and Scans:
   - Conduct thorough reviews of your GraphQL schema, resolvers, and access control mechanisms.

By addressing these root causes and implementing robust authorization mechanisms, developers can significantly reduce the risk of GraphQL Authorization Misconfigurations and create more secure GraphQL APIs.
