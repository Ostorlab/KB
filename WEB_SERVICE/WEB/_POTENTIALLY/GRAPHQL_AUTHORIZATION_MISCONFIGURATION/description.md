The Provided endpoint is detected to have a potential GraphQL authentication misconfiguration where two different queries return the same object type, but one of them might lack proper authorization controls.
This affects sensitive information that should be restricted to authorized users.
Attackers can exploit the unprotected query to access data they shouldn't have permission to view, potentially leading to exposure of personal information, business secrets, or other confidential data.
