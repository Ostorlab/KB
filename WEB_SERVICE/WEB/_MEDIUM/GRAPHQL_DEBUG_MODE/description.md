GraphQL Debug Mode is a feature that, when enabled, provides detailed error messages and stack traces in responses. While this is invaluable during development, leaving it enabled in a production environment can potentially expose sensitive information about the server's internal structure and implementation details.

When debug mode is enabled, error responses may include:
- Detailed stack traces
- Database query information
- Internal server paths and file names
- Sensitive configuration details

Example of a response with debug mode enabled:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Cannot query field \"nonexistentField\" on type \"Query\".",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 3,
          "column": 3
        }
      ],
      "stack": "GraphQLError: Cannot query field \"nonexistentField\" on type \"Query\".\n    at validateField (/app/node_modules/graphql/validation/rules/FieldsOnCorrectTypeRule.js:48:31)\n    at ..."
    }
  ],
  "data": null
}
```

Security Impact of GraphQL Debug Mode:
- **Information Disclosure**: Debug information can reveal internal details about the GraphQL server's structure, dependencies, and potential vulnerabilities, which could be leveraged by attackers to plan more targeted attacks.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Stack traces and error messages might inadvertently include sensitive information such as database queries, internal file paths, or environment variables.
- **Easier Exploitation**: Detailed error messages can assist attackers in refining their attacks by providing immediate feedback on what worked or didn't work in their malicious queries.
