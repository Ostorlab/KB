To mitigate the risks associated with GraphQL Debug Mode, consider the following recommendations:

1. **Disable Debug Mode in Production**: Ensure that GraphQL debug mode is disabled in production environments. Debug information should only be available in development and testing environments.

2. **Use Environment-Specific Settings**: Implement environment-specific configurations to control debug mode and error verbosity.

3. **Implement Custom Error Handling**: Create a custom error handling mechanism that sanitizes error messages before sending them to clients in production, removing any sensitive information while still providing useful feedback.

4. **Secure Logging**: Implement secure logging mechanisms that store detailed error information for later analysis, rather than exposing it through debug mode.

Example of controlling debug mode in Django Graphene:

```python
# settings.py

DEBUG = False  # Set to True only in development

GRAPHENE = {
    'MIDDLEWARE': [
        'graphene_django.debug.DjangoDebugMiddleware',
    ] if DEBUG else []
}

# Custom error handling
from graphene_django.views import GraphQLView
from django.http import JsonResponse
from django.conf import settings

class CustomGraphQLView(GraphQLView):
    @staticmethod
    def format_error(error):
        if settings.DEBUG:
            return GraphQLView.format_error(error)
        return {"message": "An error occurred"}

    def execute_graphql_request(self, *args, **kwargs):
        result = super().execute_graphql_request(*args, **kwargs)
        if result.errors:
            errors = [self.format_error(e) for e in result.errors]
            return JsonResponse({"errors": errors})
        return result

# Use CustomGraphQLView in your urls.py
```

This setup ensures that detailed debug information (including SQL queries) is only available in development environments. In production, errors are sanitized to prevent information leakage.

For other GraphQL server implementations, consult the specific documentation on how to control debug mode and implement secure error handling.
