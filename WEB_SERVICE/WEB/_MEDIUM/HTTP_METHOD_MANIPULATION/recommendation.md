To mitigate the risks associated with **HTTP Method Manipulation** in GraphQL, follow these security practices:

1. **Enforce POST-only Mutations**: Ensure that mutations can only be executed via the POST method. Reject any mutation requests made using GET to prevent sensitive information from being passed in URLs.
  
2. **Disable GET for Mutations**: Update server configurations to explicitly disallow mutations over GET requests. This ensures that no data-altering operations can be performed via a URL.

3. **Use Secure Proxies**: If a proxy is used to route requests, ensure it does not log sensitive URLs, or implement logging sanitization to remove sensitive information from the logs.

4. **Monitor and Test Regularly**: Continuously test GraphQL endpoints for method manipulation vulnerabilities. Ensure that mutation requests can only be executed via the appropriate HTTP method.

```python
# Enforce POST-only mutations in a Flask-based GraphQL app

from flask import request, jsonify
from flask_graphql import GraphQLView

@app.route('/graphql', methods=['POST'])
def graphql():
    if request.method != 'POST':
        return jsonify({"error": "Only POST requests allowed for mutations"}), 405

    return GraphQLView.as_view('graphql')()
