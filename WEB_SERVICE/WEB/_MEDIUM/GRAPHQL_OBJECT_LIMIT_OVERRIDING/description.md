Object Limit Overriding in GraphQL refers to a vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate the request to exceed the intended limits of an API, leading to potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or excessive resource consumption. This is particularly concerning in GraphQL, where complex queries can result in extensive data retrieval and processing if not properly restricted.

### Potential Risks:

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers may send overly complex queries that consume excessive server resources, causing performance degradation or outages.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Large queries or mutations can overload the serverâ€™s memory and processing capabilities.
- **Increased Costs:** For cloud-based services, complex queries may result in unexpected costs due to high resource usage.

### How to Check:

To determine if an application is vulnerable to object limit overriding, review the following:

- **Query Complexity:** Analyze if the API has controls to limit the complexity of queries.
- **Depth Limiting:** Check if there are restrictions on the depth of nested queries.
- **Rate Limiting:** Ensure there are rate limits applied to API requests to prevent abuse.
