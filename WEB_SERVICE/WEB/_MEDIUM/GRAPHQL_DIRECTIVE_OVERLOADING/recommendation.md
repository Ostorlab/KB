To mitigate the risk of Directive Overloading attacks, you can take the following steps:

- **Implement timeouts**: Implementing timeouts to `kill` queries that take too long to resolve can be highly effective. By setting a maximum execution time, you can automatically terminate queries that exceed this limit, preventing them from consuming excessive server resources. 

- **Limit Directives**: Implement server-side limits on the number of directives allowed in a single GraphQL query. You can configure tools like `GraphQL Armor` to limit directives and prevent overloading.

=== "JavaScript"
  ```javascript
  // Configuring for GraphQL Armor
  GraphQLArmorConfig({
    maxDirectives: {
      // Toogle the plugin | default: true
      enabled?: boolean,
    
      // Directives threshold | default: 50
      n?: int,

      // Callbacks that are ran whenever a Query is accepted
      onAccept?: GraphQLArmorAcceptCallback[],

      // Callbacks that are ran whenever a Query is rejected
      onReject?: GraphQLArmorRejectCallback[],

      // Do you want to propagate the rejection to the client? | default: true
      propagateOnRejection?: boolean,
    }
  })
  ```


=== "Python"
  ```python
  import graphql
  from graphql.language import ast
  from graphql.language import parser
  from settings import api

  def validate_directives(query: str) -> None:
      """
      This validation prevents the execution of queries containing an excessive
      amount of directives to prevent abuse.
      """

      class DirectivesParser(parser.Parser):
          def parse_directives(self, is_const: bool) -> list[ast.DirectiveNode]:
              directives = 0
              while self.peek(graphql.TokenKind.AT):
                  directives += 1
                  if directives > api.API_MAX_DIRECTIVES:
                      raise graphql.GraphQLError("Exception - Max directives exceeded")
                  self.parse_directive(is_const)
              return []

      ast_parser = DirectivesParser(query)
      ast_parser.parse_document()
  ```
