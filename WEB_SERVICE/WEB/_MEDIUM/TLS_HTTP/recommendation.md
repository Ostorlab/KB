It is recommended to ensure the use of an encrypted channel for requests transmitting sensitive data. It is, however

sensitive requests could be leveraged to access sensitive data.

The encrypted channel should use secure protocols and cipher suites, do not develop custom encryption protocols or
algorithms.
