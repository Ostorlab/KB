To prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities, you should:

- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements whenever possible. This separates user input from the SQL query and makes it much more difficult for attackers to inject malicious code.

- Avoid using dynamic SQL or string concatenation to build queries, as these methods can make it easier for attackers to inject malicious code.

- Sanitize and validate all user input before using it to construct SQL queries. This can involve removing any potentially dangerous characters or data from user input, and ensuring that only valid data is used to construct SQL queries. Use a library or framework that provides built-in input sanitization and validation to make this process easier.

- Regularly audit your web application for security vulnerabilities, and keep your database software and web application frameworks up-to-date with the latest security patches to minimize the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities.

By following these steps, you can greatly reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks and protect your web application and database from malicious actors.
