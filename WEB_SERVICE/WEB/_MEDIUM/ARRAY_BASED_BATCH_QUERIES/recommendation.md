To mitigate the risk of array-based batch queries attacks in GraphQL, where multiple queries are bundled into a single request, you can apply the following strategies:

- **Implement Query Complexity Limits**: Set rules that account for the number of queries being processed in a single request. This helps limit the load on the server and prevents attackers from sending excessively large batches of queries.
- **Limit the Number of Queries Per Request**: Enforce server-side restrictions on how many queries can be sent in a single batch. Tools like GraphQL Armor can help impose limits and prevent resource overloading through array-based batch queries.

=== "JavaScript"
  ```JavaScript
    // Configuring for GraphQL Armor
    GraphQLArmorConfig({
        maxBatchQueries: {
            // Enable or disable the plugin | default: true
            enabled: true,

            // Set the maximum number of queries allowed per request | default: 5
            n: 5,

            // Callbacks to execute when a query batch is accepted
            onAccept: [],

            // Callbacks to execute when a query batch is rejected
            onReject: [],

            // Propagate rejection details to the client | default: true
            propagateOnRejection: true,
        }
    });
  ```
=== "Python"
  ```Python
    import graphql
    from graphql.language import ast
    from graphql.language import parser
    from settings import api

    def validate_batch_queries(query: str) -> None:
        """
        This validation prevents the execution of requests containing excessive
        batch queries to avoid overloading the server.
        """
        class BatchQueryParser(parser.Parser):
            def parse_batch_queries(self) -> list[ast.OperationDefinitionNode]:
                query_count = 0
                while self.peek(graphql.TokenKind.BRACKET_L):
                    self.parse_operation_definition()
                    query_count += 1
                    if query_count > api.API_MAX_BATCH_QUERIES:
                        raise graphql.GraphQLError("Exception - Max batch queries exceeded")
                return []

        ast_parser = BatchQueryParser(query)
        ast_parser.parse_document()
