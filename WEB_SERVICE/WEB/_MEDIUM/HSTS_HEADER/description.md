This vulnerability indicates that the server does not support the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header, or it is misconfigured.

HSTS helps protect against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking by ensuring that browsers always connect using HTTPS.

If HSTS is not configured properly, attackers could potentially force the use of an insecure HTTP connection.

**Example Scenario:**
An attacker could intercept a request to the server, forcing it to use HTTP instead of HTTPS, exposing sensitive data.

**Mitigation:**
- Ensure that the HSTS header is properly configured with a sufficient max-age.
- Apply the header across all subdomains if applicable.
