To mitigate the risks associated with not having HSTS configured:

1. **Implement HSTS:**
   - Add the `Strict-Transport-Security` header with an appropriate max-age value to enforce HTTPS connections.

2. **Include Subdomains:**
   - Use the `includeSubDomains` directive to apply HSTS across all subdomains.

3. **Set Preload:**
   - Consider submitting your domain to the [HSTS preload list](https://hstspreload.org/).

4. **Enforce HTTPS:**
   - Ensure all HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS.

**Example HSTS Header Configuration in Nginx:**

For a domain with full HSTS protection, use the following Nginx configuration to enable HSTS with a max age of one year, including subdomains, and submission to the preload list:

```nginx
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
```

**Apache Configuration:**

Similarly, in Apache, you can configure HSTS using the following directive:

```apache
Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
```

- `Max-Age Value`: Ensure the max-age value is set to at least 31536000 (1 year) to align with best practices. This ensures that browsers remember the secure-only rule for an extended period.
