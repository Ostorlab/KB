Forward Secrecy (FS), also known as Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), ensures that session keys used for encrypted communications are not compromised even if the long-term server private key is leaked. This is accomplished by generating unique, ephemeral session keys for each session, which are not reused or stored.

Without Forward Secrecy, if an attacker compromises a server's long-term private key, they could potentially decrypt all past communications, violating confidentiality. Forward Secrecy prevents this by ensuring that past sessions cannot be decrypted, even if private keys are compromised.

Forward Secrecy is typically implemented using key exchange mechanisms such as:
- **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE)**
- **Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE)**

**Risks of Not Implementing Forward Secrecy:**
1. **Retroactive Decryption**: Attackers can decrypt historical data if they obtain the private key.
2. **Increased Attack Surface**: Lack of FS increases exposure to advanced attacks such as those involving compromised private keys.
3. **Compliance Violations**: Many security standards and regulations recommend the use of Forward Secrecy to safeguard encrypted data.

**Example Scenario:**
An attacker who compromises a server's private key could decrypt all previously captured traffic if Forward Secrecy is not enabled. Sensitive data such as login credentials, financial information, or personal data could be exposed.

Failure to implement Forward Secrecy could also impact compliance with security standards like PCI DSS, GDPR, and HIPAA, which emphasize strong encryption and data protection mechanisms.
