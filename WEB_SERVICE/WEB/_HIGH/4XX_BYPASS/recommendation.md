# 4Xx-Bypass

To mitigate the risk of 4xx-bypass vulnerabilities, organizations should implement proper access controls and authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive resources. Additionally, regularly monitoring and auditing access logs can help detect and respond to any unauthorized access attempts in a timely manner. Regularly updating and patching software and systems can also help prevent known vulnerabilities from being exploited.

Here are some recommendations:
  * **HTTP methods limitations**: Limit which HTTP methods can access each of your views/resources.
  * **Query parameter sanitization**: Sanitize each request's query parameters and make sure only a limited set of parameters can have an effect on the server's logic.
  * **Header limitations**: Make sure to limit what headers can effect your code, use strict rules on what header/method combos can make changes on the servers's side.
  * **Path parsing**: Robust path parsing with strict rules and refuse requests that don't conform to your rules.

   ```python
  @app.route('/path_limiting_method_usage', methods=['GET', 'POST'])  
  def path_limiting_method_usage():
      if request.method == 'GET':
          return jsonify({"message": "This is a GET request"})
      elif request.method == 'POST':
          data = request.json
          return jsonify({"message": "This is a POST request", "data": data})
   ```
