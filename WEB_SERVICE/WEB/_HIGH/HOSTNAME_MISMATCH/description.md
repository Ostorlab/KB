A hostname mismatch in an SSL/TLS certificate occurs when the domain name specified in the certificate does not match the actual hostname of the server. This mismatch can lead to security warnings in browsers and potential vulnerabilities to man-in-the-middle attacks.

Key points about hostname mismatches:

1. **Certificate Validation:** Browsers and clients check if the hostname they're connecting to matches the Common Name (CN) or is included in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field of the certificate.

2. **Security Warnings:** A mismatch triggers security warnings in browsers, potentially deterring users from accessing the site.

3. **Man-in-the-Middle Vulnerability:** Attackers could potentially exploit this mismatch to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks by presenting a valid certificate for a different domain.

4. **Subdomain Issues:** Mismatches often occur when using wildcard certificates incorrectly or when not including all relevant subdomains in the certificate.

**Real-World Implications:**

A corporate intranet site using a certificate issued for a different domain would trigger security warnings for all users. This could lead to decreased productivity as users hesitate to access the site, or worse, become desensitized to security warnings in general.
