To address expired certificate issues:

1. Implement automated monitoring tools to prevent certificates from expiring unnoticed.
2. Ensure emergency procedures are in place for rapid renewal in case of unexpected expiration.
3. Regularly audit SSL/TLS certificate inventory to avoid expired certificates.
