An expired SSL/TLS certificate is no longer trusted by browsers and clients, leading to broken trust chains, security warnings, and exposure to potential security vulnerabilities, including man-in-the-middle attacks.

Key Points:

- Expired Certificates: Expired certificates are no longer trusted by browsers, causing alarming security warnings and broken trust, which can harm business operations.
- User Impact: Security warnings deter users, often resulting in loss of trust and abandoned transactions, especially in e-commerce platforms.
- Security Risks: Expired certificates can be exploited for man-in-the-middle attacks, exposing communications to interception or forgery.
