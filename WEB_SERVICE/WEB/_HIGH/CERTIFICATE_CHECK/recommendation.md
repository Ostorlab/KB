To mitigate the risks associated with SSL certificate validation issues, consider the following recommendations:

1. **Keep Certificates Up-to-Date:**
   - Implement a process to track certificate expiration dates and renew them well before they expire.
   - Consider using automated certificate management tools or services to handle renewals.

2. **Use Strong Key Sizes:**
   - For RSA keys, use a minimum key size of 2048 bits. 3072 bits or higher is recommended for long-term security.
   - Consider using elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) with appropriate curve sizes (e.g., P-256, P-384) for better performance and security.

3. **Use Secure Signature Algorithms:**
   - Avoid weak algorithms like MD5 and SHA1.
   - Use SHA-256 or stronger hash algorithms for certificate signatures.

4. **Ensure Proper Hostname Matching:**
   - Configure certificates with the correct Common Name (CN) and Subject Alternative Names (SANs) to match all domain names and subdomains used by your services.
   - Use wildcard certificates judiciously and only for closely related subdomains under your control.

5. **Implement Certificate Pinning:**
   - For mobile apps or critical services, consider implementing certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks even if an attacker obtains a valid certificate for your domain.

6. **Monitor Certificate Transparency Logs:**
   - Regularly monitor Certificate Transparency logs for any unauthorized certificates issued for your domains.

7. **Use Reliable Certificate Authorities:**
   - Obtain certificates from well-known, reputable Certificate Authorities (CAs) that follow industry standards and best practices.
