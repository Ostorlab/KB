To mitigate the risks associated with **HTTP Method Manipulation** in GraphQL, follow these security practices:

1. **Enforce POST-only Mutations**: Ensure that mutations can only be executed via the POST method. Reject any mutation requests made using GET to prevent sensitive information from being passed in URLs.
  
2. **Disable GET for Mutations**: Update server configurations to explicitly disallow mutations over GET requests. This ensures that no data-altering operations can be performed via a URL.

=== "Python"
  ```python

  from flask import request, jsonify
  from flask_graphql import GraphQLView

  @app.route('/graphql', methods=['POST'])
  def graphql():
      return GraphQLView.as_view('graphql')()
  ```
=== "javaScript"
  ```javascript
  // Example of setting method restrictions in Express.js
  app.post('/graphql', (req, res) => {
    // Handle GraphQL mutations here
  });
    
  app.get('/graphql', (req, res) => {
    res.status(405).send('Method Not Allowed'); // Reject GET requests
   });
   ```
