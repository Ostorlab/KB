To mitigate the risks associated with GraphQL Tracing, consider the following recommendations:

1. **Disable Tracing in Production**: Ensure that GraphQL tracing is disabled in production environments. Tracing should only be enabled temporarily for debugging purposes and in controlled environments.

2. **Implement Access Controls**: If tracing must be enabled in production for certain scenarios, implement strict access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the tracing data.

3. **Sanitize Tracing Data**: If tracing data must be exposed, implement sanitization mechanisms to remove any potentially sensitive information before sending it to clients.

4. **Use Application Performance Monitoring (APM) Tools**: Instead of relying on GraphQL tracing for performance monitoring in production, consider using dedicated APM tools that provide more secure and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

Example of disabling tracing in Apollo Server:

=== "javascript"

```javascript
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  tracing: false, // Disable tracing
});
```

=== "Python"

```python
from graphene import Schema
from graphql import GraphQLBackend

class CustomBackend(GraphQLBackend):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(traceback_enabled=False)

schema = Schema(query=Query, mutation=Mutation)
result = schema.execute(
    query,
    backend=CustomBackend()
)
```

For other GraphQL server implementations, consult the specific documentation on how to disable tracing or control its behavior in different environments.
