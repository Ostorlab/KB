To mitigate the risk associated with inappropriate TTL values, consider the following recommendations:

- **Set Appropriate TTL Values**: Configure TTL values based on the expected frequency of DNS record updates. For records that change frequently, set lower TTLs to ensure timely propagation.  
- **Avoid Excessively High TTL Values**: Keep TTL values below 86400 seconds (24 hours) to prevent delays in DNS updates.  
- **Avoid Excessively Low TTL Values**: Set TTL values above 300 seconds to reduce unnecessary DNS query traffic and server load.  
- **Regularly Monitor DNS Records**: Periodically audit TTL values across your DNS records to ensure they are optimized for current needs.  
- **Adjust TTL for Planned Changes**: Before major DNS changes, lower TTL values temporarily to ensure rapid propagation of updates.
