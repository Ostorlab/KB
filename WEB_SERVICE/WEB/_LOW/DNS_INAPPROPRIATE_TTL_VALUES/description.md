Time-to-Live (TTL) values in DNS records define how long a DNS resolver should cache the record before querying the authoritative DNS server again. Incorrectly setting TTL values, whether too high or too low, can lead to inefficiencies in DNS propagation, which can impact website performance, DNS load balancing, and service failover.

Setting the right TTL values is essential for balancing performance and DNS efficiency. Inappropriate TTL values can cause various issues, depending on whether they are set too high, too low, or not set at all. Each of these scenarios can have negative consequences:

- **High TTL values (e.g., greater than 86400 seconds)**: Reduce query traffic and enhance performance, but can delay important DNS updates (e.g., IP address changes), potentially causing downtime or outdated records being served.  
- **Low TTL values (e.g., less than 300 seconds)**: Ensure faster propagation of changes, but increase DNS query traffic, leading to higher server load and degraded performance if not necessary.  
- **Missing TTL values**: Allow DNS resolvers to apply default values, which may not align with the specific needs of the domain, leading to unpredictable caching behavior and inefficiencies.
