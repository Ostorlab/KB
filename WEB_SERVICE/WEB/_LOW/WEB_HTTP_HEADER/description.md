Insecure Header Setting:

* **Content Security Policy**: Mitigates risks of cross-site scripting (XSS) by specifying trusted sources for content.
* **Cookie**: Enhances security by setting attributes like HttpOnly and Secure to protect cookie data from unauthorized access.
* **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**: Controls how resources can be shared across different domains to prevent malicious access.
* **HTTP Public Key Pinning**: Protects against man-in-the-middle attacks by specifying which public keys are valid for a particular site.
* **Redirection**: Ensures that redirects are safe and only lead to trusted destinations to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities.
* **Referrer Policy**: Defines how much referrer information is passed when navigating from one site to another, enhancing privacy.
* **Subresource Integrity**: Verifies that resources loaded from third-party domains have not been tampered with by checking their cryptographic hash.
* **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing the content type, reducing the risk of content-type-based attacks.
* **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks by controlling whether a page can be embedded in a frame.
* **X-XSS-Protection**: Activates the browser's built-in XSS filtering to block detected cross-site scripting attacks.
* **Permissions-Policy**: Controls which features and APIs can be used in the browser, enhancing security by limiting capabilities for untrusted content.
* **Clear-Site-Data**: Allows sites to request the browser to clear stored data (cookies, local storage, caches) for a specified origin, helping to mitigate the impact of data leaks or privacy concerns.
