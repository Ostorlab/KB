Brute Force Login Using Alias Batching in GraphQL involves an attacker leveraging the alias feature to automate login attempts, making it easier to submit numerous credential combinations in a single query.

In GraphQL, aliases allow clients to send multiple versions of the same query under different names. Attackers exploit this by batching login requests within a single query using different alias names for each attempt. This can lead to an efficient brute force attack, bypassing traditional rate-limiting protections and overwhelming the authentication system with login attempts.

Example:

```
query loginBatch {
  login1: login(username: "user1", password: "password1") { token }
  login2: login(username: "user2", password: "password2") { token }
  login3: login(username: "user3", password: "password3") { token }
  ...
}
```
