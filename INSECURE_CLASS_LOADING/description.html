<p>
    Android provides APIs that allow an application to dynamically load code to be executed.
    For example, an application may support plug-ins that are downloaded and then loaded at a later time. Unfortunately,
    if these plug-ins are stored in an insecure location, this process can be hijacked,
    allowing access to private data and unexpected arbitrary code execution by malicious applications

<p>Two classes allow the loading of additional code:</p>
<pre class="language-java"><code class="java, hljs">DexClassLoader (String dexPath, String dexOutputDir, String libPath, ClassLoader parent)</code></pre>
<pre class="language-java"><code class="java, hljs">PathClassLoader (String path, String libPath, ClassLoader parent)</code></pre>
