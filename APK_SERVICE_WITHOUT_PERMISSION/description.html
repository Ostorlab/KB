<p><code>service</code> is an application component that can take care of actions to be done in the background, without
    user interaction.
    <code>service</code> can also be used to expose functionalities to other applications. This corresponds to calls to
    <code>Context.bindService()</code>
    to establish a connection to the service and interact with it.</p>
<p>Unprotected services can be invoked by other applications and potentially access sensitive information or perform
    privileged actions</p>
