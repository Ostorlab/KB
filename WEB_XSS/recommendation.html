<p>In general cases, preventing XSS vulnerabilities requires a 2-step protection:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Input validation: </strong> user-controlled input should be validated to forbid all unauthorized
        characters, phone number should for instance only contain numbers; names should only contain alphabetical
        characters, etc.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Output encoding: </strong> all input shown to user is properly encoded using standard proven API. Use of
        safe template engines with native support for output encoding and secure defaults is highly recommended.
    </li>
</ul>
