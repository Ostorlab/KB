<p>Cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when unsanitized user-controlled input is served to user.</p>
<p>XSS vulnerabilities bypasses same-Origin-Policy, which is a core principal of web security. SOP ensures that a page
    from <code>http://evil.com</code> can't
    access the content of a page from <code>http://bank.com</code>.</p>
<p>XSS are commonly separated into 3 familities</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Reflected: </strong>the user-controlled input is directly reflected in the page response</li>
    <li><strong>Stored: </strong>the user-controled input is stored on the server-side, for instance in a database, and
        is later returned to user
    </li>
    <li><strong>DOM-based: </strong>the user-controlled input is injected on the client-side to the DOM, triggering the
        injection of malicious JavaScript
    </li>
</ul>
<p>XSS vulnerabilities allow an attacker to perform a variety of malcious actions, like exfiltration of personal data,
    including user session or account information; perform actions on behalf of the user.</p>
