<p><code>RELRO</code>: RELRO is a memory protection technique to harden against memory corruption exploitation
    techniques.
    RELRO prevents GOT overwrite attacks.</p>

<p><code>ASLR</code>: ASLR is a memory protection technique to harden against memory corruption exploitation technique.
    ASLR randomizes the address space of binary to prevent controlled address jumps.</p>

<p><code>No eXecute</code>: Mark memory region as non-executable to harden against memory corruption exploitation
    technique.</p>
<p><code>Stack canary</code>: Add a canary to memory that gets overwritten in the case of a memory corruption. The
    canary is checked at runtime to prevent the exploitation of the memory corruption vulnerability.</p>
