<p>Apache Cordova below version 4.1.1 suffers from multiple vulnerabilties:</p>
<ul>
    <il>CVE-2015-5256: Android applications created using Apache Cordova that use a remote server contain a
        vulnerability where whitelist restrictions for urls using protocols http and https are not properly applied.
        Whitelist cannot block network redirects from a whitelisted remote website to a non-whitelisted website.
    </il>
    <il>CVE-2015-1835: Android applications built with the Cordova framework that don't have explicit values set in
        Config.xml can have undefined configuration variables set by Intent. This can cause unwanted dialogs appearing
        in applications and changes in the application behaviour that can include the app force-closing.
    </il>
</ul>
