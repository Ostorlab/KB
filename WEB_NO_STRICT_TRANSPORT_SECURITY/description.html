<p>The HTTP <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> response header ( abbreviated  HSTS) lets a web site tell browsers that it should only be accessed using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must intercept and modify the network traffic from the target.</p>

<p>This requires the client to communicate with the server over an insecure connection such as public Wi-Fi.</p>
