<p>Apache Cordova below version 3.5.0 suffers from multiple vulnerabilties:</p>
<ul>
    <il>Apache Cordova Android before 3.5.1 allows remote attackers to change the start page via a crafted intent URL.
    </il>
    <il>Phonegap whitelisting can be bypassed by an attacker by using Websockets through Webview</il>
    <il>Apache Cordova Android before 3.5.1 allows remote attackers to bypass the HTTP whitelist and connect to
        arbitrary servers by using JavaScript to open WebSocket connections through WebView.
    </il>
    <il>Javascript can also be executed by loading a malicious site by starting an application with errorurl set to the
        malicious site.
    </il>
    <il>Phonegap whitelisting can be bypassed by an attacker. For example, if foo.com is whitelisted, foo.com.evil.com
        will pass the check.
    </il>
</ul>
