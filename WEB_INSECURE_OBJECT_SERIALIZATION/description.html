<p>The application uses an insecure deserialization scheme from untrusted data.</p>
<p>Insecure object deserialization may result in</p>
<ul>
    <li>Arbitrary remote code execution</li>
    <li>Modification of the application logic</li>
    <li>Data tampering, such as bypassing access control</li>
</ul>
<p>Exploitation of deserialization vulnerabilties is difficult, due to
    the absence of off the shelf exploits and the need to to tweak them for the
    targetted exploit.</p>
