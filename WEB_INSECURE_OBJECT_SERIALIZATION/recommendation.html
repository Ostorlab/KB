<p>To prevent object serialization vulneravilities, the application must either:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Accept serialized objects from trusted sources only</li>
    <li>Use serialization primitive data types only</li>
</ul>
<p>If these measures are not possible, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Implementing integrity checks such as digital signatures on any serialized objects to prevent hostile object
        creation or data tampering.
    </li>
    <li>Enforcing strict type constraints during deserialization before object creation as the code typically expects a
        definable set of classes. Bypasses to this technique have been demonstrated, so reliance solely on this is not
        advisable.
    </li>
    <li>Isolating and running code that deserializes in low privilege environments when possible.</li>
    <li>Logging deserialization exceptions and failures, such as where the incoming type is not the expected type, or
        the deserialization throws exceptions.
    </li>
    <li>Restricting or monitoring incoming and outgoing network connectivity from containers or servers that
        deserialize.
    </li>
    <li>Monitoring deserialization, alerting if a user deserializes
        constantly.
    </li>
</ul>
